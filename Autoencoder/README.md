# Autoencoder
## Definition
They work by compressing the input into a latent-space representation, and then reconstructing the output from this representation. This kind of network is composed of two parts :


- Encoder: This is the part of the network that compresses the input into a latent-space representation. It can be represented by an encoding function $h=f(x)$.


- Decoder: This part aims to reconstruct the input from the latent space representation. It can be represented by a decoding function $r=g(h)$.
